1. transistor needs to change to c825a or any onther common one
2. should implement a in-circuit programming system for 16f628a
3. 3.3 volt power supply ic needs to change its position.. place in little bit    downward. 
4. reduce the overall hight. 5v power supply module should be placed without consil. so there are some changes needed. can be drilled near power pins. 
5. 16f628's ic holder hight must be reduced.
